In our findings we can determine that kickstarters for plays in the US are successful 76% of the time. In order for Louise to have the best chance for success is to have her Kickstarter have a manageable goal and in production during the right time of the year based on popularity.
Theater plays have the highest success in the early summer, preferably in May or June. The least successful time for a performance would be September through March.

We can determine based on the data that the average pledged amount of successful productions was roughly $5,600 and exceeded the average goal of $5,050. A successful goal for Louise's kickstarter shouldn't exceed $5,000. As the average donation of successful US Kickstarter Plays is roughly $90, I would reccomend in her search for donations to have preset domination amounts in $50 increments.
