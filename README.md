# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of analyzing the supplied data set is to determine Louise's best chance of success for her campaign. We are able to determine a practical goal for Louise's campaign to succeed, as well as the best timeframe for this campaign to take place from previous campaigns of similar nature.
## Analysis and Challenges
While there were no challenges with the data set, 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater campaigns are most successful in early summer months; May and June having the highest success rate. This could be due to higher likliness of summer travel in July/August due to the holidays. This time frame can also be more feasible for families to attend with the school year ending, and excitment at a high.
Theater campaigns are least successful in the Fall & Winter months. This could be caused due to the holiday season, giving potential theater goers a less than likely chance of visiting the theater unless it is a holiday themed campaign which has it's own set of limitations.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

In conclusion, theater campaigns are most successful if planned in either May or June; June having a 65% success rate. Theater campaigns that are planned in Fall & Winter months are at a higher risk of failure, close to 50% of campaigns at that time of year are unable to proceed. Having an obtainable goal of $5,000 has been proven to have the highest success rate compared to other theater campaigns.

While anazlyzing the data, I have determined that there may be some additional research that could help lead to even deeper results for success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?


In our findings we can determine that kickstarters for plays in the US are successful 76% of the time. In order for Louise to have the best chance for success is to have her Kickstarter have a manageable goal and in production during the right time of the year based on popularity.


Theater plays have the highest success in the early summer, preferably in May or June. The least successful time for a performance would be September through March.



We can determine based on the data that the average pledged amount of successful productions was roughly $5,600 and exceeded the average goal of $5,050. A successful goal for Louise's kickstarter shouldn't exceed $5,000. As the average donation of successful US Kickstarter Plays is roughly $90, I would reccomend in her search for donations to have preset domination amounts in $50 increments.
